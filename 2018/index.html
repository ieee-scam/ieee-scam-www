              <h3>Welcome to SCAM'18!</h3>

              <p>The aim of the International Working Conference on Source
                 Code Analysis &amp; Manipulation (SCAM) is to bring together
                 researchers and practitioners working on theory,
                 techniques and applications which concern analysis and/or
                 manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While
                 much attention in the wider software engineering community
                 is properly directed towards other aspects of systems
                 development and evolution, such as specification, design
                 and requirements engineering, it is the source code that
                 contains the only precise description of the behaviour of
                 the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code
                 thus remains a pressing concern.</p>

              <h3>Call for Research Track Papers</h3>

              <p>The 18th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2018) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term "source code" refers to any fully executable description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term "analysis" refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that yields insight into source code, while "manipulation" refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of a system. Hence, the analysis and manipulation of source code remains a pressing concern for which SCAM 2018 solicits high quality paper submissions.</p>

              <h3>Covered Topics and Paper Formats</h3>

              <p>We welcome submission of papers that describe original and significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>program transformation and refactoring</li>
                <li>static and dynamic analysis</li>
                <li>natural language analysis of source code artifacts</li>
                <li>repository, revision, and change analysis</li>
                <li>source level metrics</li>
                <li>decompilation</li>
                <li>bug location and prediction</li>
                <li>security vulnerability analysis</li>
                <li>source-level testing and verification</li>
                <li>clone detection</li>
                <li>concern, concept, and feature localization and mining</li>
                <li>program comprehension</li>
                <li>bad smell detection</li>
                <li>abstract interpretation</li>
                <li>program slicing</li>
                <li>source level optimization</li>
                <li>energy efficient source code</li>
              </ul>

              <p>SCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or technological domain that can be applied to these and similar topics. Submitted papers should describe original, unpublished, and significant work and must not have been previously accepted for publication nor be concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. Papers must not exceed 10 pages including all text, references, appendices and figures and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines and must be clearly marked as a research paper. Templates in Latex and Word are available on <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE's website</a>. All submissions must be in English.</p>

              <p>The papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2018">EasyChair</a>. Submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the <a data-toggle="pill" href="#progcom">program committee</a>, judging the paper on its novelty, quality, importance, evaluation, and scientific rigor. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper.</p>

              <p>SCAM 2018 also features an <a data-toggle="pill" href="#engcall">engineering paper track</a> for papers that report on the design and implementation of tools for source code analysis and manipulation.</p>

              <h3>Proceedings</h3>

              <p>All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be available through the IEEE Digital Library.</p>

              <h4>Special Issue</h4>

              <p>A set of the best papers from SCAM 2018 will be invited to be considered for revision, extension, and publication in a special journal issue.</p>

              <h3>Call for Engineering Track Papers</h3>

              <p>In addition to the research track (see separate <a data-toggle="pill" href="#call">CFP</a>), the 18th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2018) will also feature an Engineering track. This track welcomes six-page papers that report on the design and implementation of tools for source code analysis and manipulation, as well as libraries, infrastructure, and the real world studies enabled by these advances. To be clear, this is not the addition of a new track to SCAM but rather a significant expansion to the scope of the tools track of previous SCAMs.</p>

              <p>What artefacts qualify as “engineering track” material?</p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>tools</b>: software (or hardware!) programs that facilitate SCAMmy activities.</li>
                <li><b>libraries</b>: reusable API-enabled frameworks for the above.</li>
                <li><b>infrastructure</b>: while libraries are purely software, infrastructure can include projects that provide/facilitate access to data and analysis.</li>
                <li><b>data</b>: reusable datasets for other researchers to replicated and innovate with.</li>
                <li><b>real world studies</b> enabled by these advances. Here the focus is on how the {tool,infrastructure, etc} enabled the study, and not so much the study itself. The novelty of the research question is less important than the engineering challenges faced in the study.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>A successful SCAM engineering track paper should:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Fall under the topics mentioned for the <a data-toggle="pill" href="#call">SCAM 2018 research track</a>.</li>
                <li>Discuss engineering work artefacts that have NOT been published before. However, previous work involving the tool, but for which the tool was not the main contribution, are acceptable.</li>
                <li>Motivate the use cases (and hence the existence) of the engineering work.</li>
                <li>Relate the engineering project to earlier work, if any.</li>
                <li>Describe the experiences gained in developing this contribution.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Optionally (and encouraged):</p>

              <ol start="6">
                <li>Any empirical results or user feedback is welcome.</li>
                <li>Contain the URL of a website where the tool/library/data etcetera can be downloaded, together with example data and clear installation guidelines, preferably but not necessarily open source.</li>
                <li>Contain the URL to a video demonstrating the usage of the contribution.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Note that the submission length has a limit of six pages, in contrast to the two to four pages of traditional tool demo papers. The expectation is  that authors  use the space to discuss artefact motivation, design, and use cases in much more detail. For example, a use case would be well illustrated by a demo scenario with screenshots.</p>

              <p>Each submission will be reviewed by members of the <a data-toggle="pill" href="#progcom">engineering track program committee</a>. Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their artefacts at the conference. All accepted engineering track papers will be published in the conference proceedings. The key criterion for acceptance is that the paper should (a) follow the above mentioned guidelines and (b) make an original contribution that can benefit practitioners in the field now and/or others designing and building artefacts for source code analysis and manipulation. The artefacts can range from an early research prototype to a polished product ready for deployment. Papers about commercial products are allowed, as long as the guidelines described above are followed.</p>

              <p>Videos and other demo material may be taken into account by reviewers as they review the paper. However, such material will not become part of the permanent record of the conference, so the paper should be self contained. In order to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers, such material should be hosted on an anonymous public source (e.g., YouTube), or made available in such a way that the tools chair can download them once and redistribute them to reviewers</p>

              <h3>Proceedings</h3>

              <p>All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.</p>

              <h3>Important Dates</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>Abstract Deadline: June 8, 2018</li>
                <li>Paper Deadline: June 15, 2018</li>

                <li>Conference: Sep 23-24, 2018</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Submission</h3>

                <h4>Madrid, Spain</h4>
                <p>
                  Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain, as well as the capital of the autonomous community of the same name (Comunidad de Madrid).
                  The population of the city is roughly 3.3 million with a metro area population of almost 6.5 million.
                  Madrid is best known for its great cultural and artistic heritage, a good example of which is the El Prado museum (a detailed travel guide can be found <a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en">here</a>).
                  Madrid also boasts some of the liveliest nightlife in the world.
