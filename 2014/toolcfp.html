<h1>Call for tool papers</h1>
<p>Apart from a research track (see separate CFP), the 14th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2014) will also feature a Tool Paper track. This track welcomes six-page papers that report on the design and implementation of tools for source code analysis and manipulation.</p>

<p>In essence, a good tool paper should:</p>

<ol>
<li>fall under the topics mentioned for the SCAM 2014 research track</li>
<li>discuss a tool that has NOT been published before as a tool paper</li>
<li>motivate the use cases (and hence the existence) of the tool</li>
<li>relate the tool to earlier work</li>
<li>describe the tool’s architecture and explain its inner workings</li>
<li>describe the experiences gained in developing the tool</li>
<li>NOT necessarily contain a large-scale empirical study of the tool</li>
<li>BUT any empirical results or user feedback is welcome</li>
<li>mention the URL of a website where the tool (or a demo) can be downloaded, together with example data</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the submission length has a limit of six pages, compared to the two to four pages of traditional tool demo papers. This gives authors enough space to discuss tool motivation, design, and use cases in much more detail. For example, a use case would be well illustrated by a demo scenario with screenshots.
The papers should be submitted electronically via the conference web site (<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2014">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2014</a>).</p>

<p>Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the tool track program committee. Authors of accepted tool papers will be required to present their tool at the conference. All accepted tool papers will be published in the conference proceedings. The key criterion for acceptance is that the paper should (a) follow the above mentioned guidelines and (b)*  make an original contribution that can benefit practitioners in the field now and/or others designing and building tools for source code analysis and manipulation. The tool can be in an early research prototype or a polished product ready for deployment. Papers about commercial tools are allowed, as long as the guidelines described above are followed.</p>

<p>Authors are encouraged to reference supporting resources, including video demos of their tool (created using screen capture tools like CamStudio or Jing), and reviewers may take this information into account as they review the paper. However, such material will not become part of the permanent record of the conference, so the paper should be self contained. In order to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers, such material should be hosted on an anonymous public source (e.g., youtube), or made available in such a way that the tools chair can download them once and redistribute them to reviewers. If authors would like to inform reviewers of additional information that does not appear in the paper, such information can be emailed to the tools chair.</p>
